This is a Multi column Image picker that has some customization option
Column Amount  -  Image size  -  Temperature - Brightness

You can add multiple images at the same time and either randomize 1 column or all columns at the same time
( Just be aware that the multi columns randomization only works if you fill all the columns from left to right, any column empty on the left side of a column with images will result in a function error.)

To use it all you need is to download the files and place them in the same folder without changing the order.
Then double click on the "index.html".
This should open it up on your browser.
